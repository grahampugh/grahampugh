# Currently most active projects üßëüèº‚Äçüíª

My most popular and demanding project is üóÇÔ∏è [erase-install](https://github.com/grahampugh/erase-install), a zsh script for upgrading, reinstalling and erasing macOS. This was updated significantly in 2022 to use [mist-cli](https://github.com/ninxsoft/mist-cli) and [swiftDialog](https://github.com/swiftDialog/swiftDialog), and has to keep pace with changes to those projects as well as changes to macOS itself.

My other most used project is [JamfUploader](https://github.com/grahampugh/jamf-upload). This is a collection of python processors for use with [AutoPkg](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg) which is the dominant method for integrating AutoPkg with Jamf Pro. 2023 saw significant updates to the JamfPackageUploader processor, after Jamf provided a new version of their Cloud Distribution Service (JCDS 2.0) and provided an official package upload API endpoint/method for the first time. 

These processors are also mirrored in my AutoPkg recipes repo, [grahampugh-recipes](https://github.com/autopkg/grahampugh-recipes), along with a large collection of recipes and examples of how to write `.jamf` recipes.

## Other notable projects üìù

For those interested in an easy script for setting up AutoPkg on a fresh machine, including (optionally) configuring JamfUploader, check out [AutoPkgSetup](https://github.com/grahampugh/AutoPkgSetup).

If you need a signed package to add to your MDM to install Rosetta 2 at enrollment, check out [Rosetta-2-install](https://github.com/grahampugh/Rosetta-2-install).

If you want a tool that is somewhat like a lightweight [Nudge](https://github.com/macadmins/nudge), which doesn't require any configuration changes with time, check out [Nice Updater 2](https://github.com/grahampugh/nice-updater). Note that this is a highly altered fork of the original project by Ryan Ball, which you can check out at [ryangball/nice-updater](https://github.com/ryangball/nice-updater).

If you need to convert PLIST files to YAML, or vice versa, check out [plist-yaml-plist](https://github.com/grahampugh/plist-yaml-plist).

## Deprecations ‚ò†Ô∏è

The projects based on [python-jss](https://github.com/jssimporter/python-jss) that I inherited from Shea Craig, namely JSSImporter, Spruce, jss_helper, JSSRecipeCreator, and python-jss itself, are all now deprecated. You can still find the code in the [JSSImporter](https://github.com/jssimporter) organisation.
